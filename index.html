      <h2>What We Were</h2>
      <p>
        I still remember you saying, "Kaash tumare pass hoti would've hold you so tight." That feeling was everything. It was a strange and beautiful love, one that grew in quiet moments. Your presence made those days better than they had any right to be, and that's a memory I'll never forget.

      <h2>An Unexpected Connection</h2>
      <p>
        Neither of us saw it coming. I remember you saying it yourself, "Ajeeb sa pyaar hogya." It was true. A connection so strong it felt like we had known each other for years. Those days were made "wayyy too good" simply by your presence, filling them with a warmth that still lingers.

      <h2>Echoes of a Memory</h2>
       <p>
        I still see us, two silhouettes against a sunset sea, a perfect moment where the world was only you and me. I remember the warmth of being close, the comfort in the silence. It was in those quiet moments‚Äîa shared glance, a soft touch‚Äîthat our story was written, a silent, perfect love, without a single doubt.
