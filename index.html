      <h2>My Everything</h2>
      <p>
        I don't know what to say, except that I love you so much. It's a strange and beautiful love, and your presence has made these past days wayyy too good. Sometimes I wish I could be there with you, to hold you so tight and never let you go. You are my everything.

      <h2>Our Vibe</h2>
      <p>
        Every time you send me reels, I imagine it's us. Whether it's dancing to Spanish music or just laughing together, I've truly imagined it all with you. It's adorable, and I can't afford to stop talking to you.

      <h2>A Future With You</h2>
       <p>
        Remember when you said if we got married, you'd be Aadya Sharma? That's all I want. I really, really wish and hope and pray for all your dreams to come true, and for mine to come true with you.
