      <h2>What We Were</h2>
      <p>
        I still remember you saying, "Kaash tumare pass hoti would've hold you so tight." That feeling was everything. Your presence made those days better than they had any right to be, a strange and beautiful love I'll never forget.

      <h2>An Unexpected Connection</h2>
      <p>
        It was a strange and beautiful connection, one neither of us saw coming. I remember you saying it yourself, "Ajeeb sa pyaar hogya." It was true. Those days were made "wayyy too good" simply by your presence, and I'll never forget that feeling.

      <h2>Echoes of a Memory</h2>
       <p>
        I still see us, two silhouettes against a sunset sea, <br>
        A quiet moment, just you and me. <br>
        I remember the warmth of being close, the world shut out, <br>
        A silent, perfect love, without a single doubt.
