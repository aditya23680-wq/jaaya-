        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
        <p>
          We met in a random GC, a place I never thought would give me something so unforgettable. 
          I still remember the way you spoke, not just the words, but the way they carried this 
          warmth that made me stop and notice you. In a sea of voices, yours stood out. You had this 
          way of being yourself so effortlessly, and I couldn’t help but get drawn closer. I didn’t 
          even realize it at first, but slowly I was waiting for your messages, for your replies, 
          for that little spark only you could give me. From the very first moment, you felt like 
          someone I had been searching for without even knowing it.

        <h3>The Click</h3>
        <p>
          What started as small conversations turned into something deeper. 
          The more we talked, the more it felt like I had known you forever. 
          You made me laugh in ways I hadn’t laughed in so long, you made me feel understood, 
          and you made the world feel lighter just by being in it. Every late night talk, 
          every silly joke, every random story you shared became the highlights of my days. 
          Slowly, without even trying, you became my safe place. 
          I realized I wasn’t just talking to someone from a GC, I was talking 
          to someone who touched my heart in ways I never expected and could never forget.

        <h3>Falling for You</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t know when it truly happened, but one day I just caught myself 
          smiling at my phone, thinking about you long after our chats ended. 
          It was in the little things, the way you laughed, the way you cared, 
          the way you carried yourself without even realizing how special you were. 
          I admired everything about you silently at first, but it grew stronger 
          with every moment we shared. You became the thought I carried in my head, 
          the name my heart whispered when it was quiet. Somewhere between all those 
          conversations, I fell for you completely, and loving you felt like the most natural 
          and beautiful thing I had ever known.

        <h3>Our Dreams</h3>
        <p>
          With you, I started to dream in ways I never had before. 
          I pictured us on late night rides, the world quiet around us 
          while we laughed and held onto each other. I imagined us cooking together, 
          you playfully teasing me in the kitchen, turning something ordinary 
          into a memory I would hold forever. I wanted us to lie down under the stars, 
          pointing out constellations and talking about everything and nothing at all. 
          I saw us holding hands in crowded streets, as if the whole world 
          disappeared when you were beside me. I wanted to travel with you, 
          see new places, get lost together, and find comfort in the fact that 
          no matter where we went, it would feel like home because you were there. 
          These weren’t just fantasies, they were the little pieces of a future 
          I truly wanted with you, a future where love lived in the simplest, 
          most beautiful moments shared between us.

        <h3>The Goodbye</h3>
        <p>
          And then you left. I don’t know if words could ever explain what that did to me. 
          One day I was full of your laughter, your presence, your love, and the next 
          there was silence. It hurt in ways I can’t put into words, but even through the pain, 
          I can’t forget what we had. Because what we had was real. Every memory, every laugh, 
          every little dream we created together still lives inside me. I still carry those dreams, 
          the late night rides, the stargazing, the cooking, the travels, as if one day 
          we will pick them back up where we left off. And maybe, just maybe, if you ever look back 
          and feel even a fraction of what I feel, you will realize that some stories never really end, 
          they just wait for the right moment to begin again.
