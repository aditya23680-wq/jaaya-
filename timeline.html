        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
        <p>
          We met in a random GC, a place I never thought would give me something so unforgettable. 
          I still remember the way you spoke, not just the words, but the way they carried this warmth 
          that made me stop and notice you. In a sea of voices, yours stood out. You had this way of being 
          yourself so effortlessly, and I couldn‚Äôt help but get drawn closer. I didn‚Äôt even realize it at first, 
          but slowly I was waiting for your messages, for your replies, for that little spark only you could give me. 
          From the very first moment, you felt like someone I had been searching for without even knowing it.

        <h3>The Click</h3>
        <p>
          What started as small conversations turned into something deeper. The more we talked, the more it felt 
          like I had known you forever. You made me laugh in ways I hadn‚Äôt laughed in so long, you made me feel 
          understood, and you made the world feel lighter just by being in it. Every late night talk, every silly 
          joke, every random story you shared became the highlights of my days. Slowly, without even trying, you 
          became my safe place. I realized I wasn‚Äôt just talking to someone from a GC, I was talking to someone 
          who touched my heart in ways I never expected and could never forget.

        <h3>Falling for You</h3>
        <p>
          I don‚Äôt know when it truly happened, but one day I just caught myself smiling at my phone, thinking 
          about you long after our chats ended. It was in the little things, the way you laughed, the way you cared, 
          the way you carried yourself without even realizing how special you were. I admired everything about you 
          silently at first, but it grew stronger with every moment we shared. You became the thought I carried in 
          my head, the smile I carried in my heart. My heart would whisper your name when everything else was quiet, 
          and I knew it then‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt just talking to you anymore, I was falling in love with you. Loving you became 
          the most natural and beautiful thing I had ever known.

        <h3>Our Dreams</h3>
        <p>
          With you, I built dreams that felt so real in my heart. I imagined us on late night rides, you holding 
          onto me as the wind brushed past us, our laughter filling the night. I pictured us cooking together, 
          you teasing me while I pretended to know what I was doing, and both of us ending up laughing more than 
          actually cooking. I wanted us to lie under the stars, listening to the silence of the night, pointing 
          out constellations while secretly only looking at you. I saw us holding hands in crowded streets, not 
          caring about the world, just finding peace in being together. I wanted to travel with you, to explore 
          places we had only dreamed of, to get lost and still feel safe because you were beside me. These weren‚Äôt 
          just random wishes, they were the future I wanted with you, a life filled with the simplest and most 
          beautiful moments, all made perfect just because you were in them.

        <h3>The Goodbye</h3>
        <p>
          And then you left. I can‚Äôt explain the emptiness it left inside me. One moment my days were filled 
          with your laughter, your presence, your love, and the next there was only silence. It hurt in ways 
          I never thought words could capture. But even through the pain, I can‚Äôt forget us. Because what we had 
          was real. Every memory, every laugh, every dream we created together still lives in me. I still carry 
          those dreams‚Äîthe late night rides, the stargazing, the cooking, the travels‚ÄîI hold onto them as if one 
          day we will find our way back and live them for real. Maybe you don‚Äôt feel the same now, maybe time has 
          changed things, but if you ever look back and feel even a piece of what I feel, you‚Äôll know that our 
          story isn‚Äôt over. Some stories don‚Äôt end, they just wait for the right moment to begin again.
